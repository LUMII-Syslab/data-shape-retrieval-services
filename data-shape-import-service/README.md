# Getting Started

- clone this repository

- obtain a JSON file containing the shape info extracted from the endpoint

- create an "empty" DB schema according to the data shape server schema template, see ... . Only the record type definition tables *must* be populated.

- create an environment file (copy `sample.env` to `.env`)

- configure variables `DB_URL`, `DB_SCHEMA` and `INPUT_FILE` inside the `.env` file

- ensure that `node.js` is installed

- run `npm install` from the command line to install the prerequisites

- run `node work.js` from the command line to start the import

# Namespace table prepopulation

If desired, the namespaces table `ns` can also be prepopulated.

For any prefixes encountered in input JSON, an existing `ns` entry will be used, if possible.

For missing `ns` entries, the prefix.cc API will be queried to get the short form of the prefix.

Still unknown prefixes will get autogenerated short forms like `auto_42`.
